Check out the deployed app: https://relay-app-2020.herokuapp.com/

## Description

Relay is a full-stack, progressive web app built with React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, & a number of other technologies.

In a nutshell, Relay is a user-friendly web application that bridges the gap between exercise and safety.

The main goal is to put active people at ease, providing them with the ability to go out for walks, runs, hikes, etc. - at any time of day - and at the same time, be able to add emergency contacts, as well as log activities. When a user is out exercising, using the Relay app, their emergency contact will be updated automatically by text. Here, the emergency contact selected receives texts which include the user's location, as well as details regarding an ongoing activity.

## Installation

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
